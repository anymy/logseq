### **DataScript**
#### An immutable in-memory database and Datalog query engine in Clojure and ClojureScript
#### Minimal piece of information in DataScript is Datom
##### (defrecord Datom [e a v tx added])
###### [e a v] is entity, attribute and value
###### tx is a transaction id (integer)
###### added is a boolean flag to differentiate additions from retractions
#### Database is just an immutable, persistent collection of Datom's
##### (defrecord DB [schema eavt aevt avet max-eid max-tx rschema])
