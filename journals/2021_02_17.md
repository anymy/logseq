## The Difference Between Energy and Time Management
### Management of your time helps you to prioritize your workload throughout the day
### Managing your energy is recognizing the parts of the day where you feel the most energized
#### Recognize people or situations that drain your energy, and people and situations that refresh your energy.
##### Does the person leave you feeling drained or exhilarated?
##### Does the activity leave you more anxious or calmer?
##### Does your energy feel like it has risen or has it been depleted?
